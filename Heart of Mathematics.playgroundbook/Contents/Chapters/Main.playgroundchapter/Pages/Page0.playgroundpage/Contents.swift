 # Heart of Mathematics
 ## About the book

 "_Heart of Mathematics_" is an educational playground about the secret life of times tables.
 Experiment the beauty of the myriad of hidden beautiful patterns behind those and find out their relationship with circles and fractals!

 This work was made thanks to both the enlightening [video] made by Mathologer about times tables and the stunning blog [article] about a Mandelbrot example written by Apple.
