# Heart of Mathematics

“*Heart of mathematics*” is an interactive playground in which you will experience the infinite beauty of the patterns behind times tables, circles and fractals. This is my entry for a [WWDC 2018 scholarship](https://developer.apple.com/wwdc/scholarships/). Be sure to check out the other amazing [entries on GitHub](https://github.com/wwdc/2018)!

## Features

  - See how circular times tables are generated
  - See how rotating circles can trace shapes
  - See how Generalized Mandelbrot sets work
  - Find out the hidden links between the three them
  - Have fun with color customisation!

## Installation

You need an **iPad** in order to run it. Just download the latest release and then AirDrop or move to iCloud Drive the .playgroundbook file inside the release .zip file. Open Swift Playgrounds on your iPad and then "*Heart of Mahtematics*" and you are ready to go!

## Credits

This work is based off a really beautiful [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhbuKbxJsk8) made by a mathematician on YouTube named Mathologer in which he explained the hidden links behind these different ways of tracing these stunning shapes.
